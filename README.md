Codebase as Database JavaScript preprocessor and tool-chain using JavaScript as the macro language.

Uses JavaScript to run a development tool-chain, which tidies source code allowing organization along the lines of a database.

Lines of source code are equivalent to records with fields including: JS code (normally 104 ASCII characters); Comment (unlimited length, avoid escape character); miscellaneous key-value data.

From this codebase the tool-chain generates: industry standard prettified code; and/or, documentation; and/or, test code; and/or custom products. 

JavaScript does not have a standard preprocessor, although many frameworks and language extensions can be seen as preprocessor/compilers. An optional part of this tool-chain is macro-expansion/processing using JavaScript as the macro language.
